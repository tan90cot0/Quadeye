1. Initially, the CSV files were converted into Pandas DataFrame objects
2. Subsequently, missing entries were identified in column A using isna() method.
3. To handle these missing entries, time-based interpolation was applied using the interpolate(method='time') function. 
4. This approach aimed to estimate missing values based on surrounding timestamps, thereby filling the gaps in the data. 
5. After the interpolation, the values were adjusted based on the correlation of column A with column B.
